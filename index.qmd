# Hi, I'm Gurmehak

Iâ€™m a curious and detail-oriented data scientist with a background in management consulting. I enjoy uncovering 
the stories hidden in messy data and turning complex problems into clear, actionable insights.

For three years, I worked at [**ZS Associates**](https://www.zs.com/), a leading consulting firm in the pharmaceutical 
and life sciences space, partnering with pharma clients to drive data-backed 
decision-making. I led projects in revenue recovery, market access, and forecasting, designing scalable analytics 
solutions that impacted millions in revenue.

I recently completed my [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/vancouver) at the 
**University of British Columbia**, where I specialized in machine learning, statistical modeling, cloud 
computing and time series analysis. I am currently working part-time with the 
[Centre for Brain Health](https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/), developing data pipelines and dashboards to 
support neuroscience research.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Electronics and Communications Engineering** from 
[NSIT, University of Delhi](http://www.nsut.ac.in/en/department/Electronics%20and%20Communication%20Engineering), 
where I built foundational skills in programming, database management and systems engineering.
